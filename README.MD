Neuroscience:
The brain can heal, but it takes time.
The conscious can process 120 bits of information per second.
The subconscious can process 11 million bits of information per second.
An average person has 12 k to 60 k thoughts per day.
We can experience sensory stimuli that's presented for as little as 50 milliseconds (about one-twentieth of a second). It is thought that our brains can, in fact, respond to information that's much briefer than this, lasting less than a quarter of a millisecond.
At least 0.5 ms per synapse. Synapses are cleared within about 1 ms.
A nerve impulse travels at a maximum speed of 120 m/sec.
Humans with normal hearing can hear sounds between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz.
The human ear detects half a millisecond delay in sound.

Electronics:
Hertz is an unit of frequency (of change in state or cycle in a sound wave, alternating current, or other cyclical waveform) of one cycle per second.
1 second = 1000 millisecond. 20,000/1000=20.

Psychology:
20 times hypnosis?
The average person can only hold about 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory at a time. New hacking target? Maybe not the same methods, but could be a start. Look into neuro linguistic programming(NLP), read into neuroscience and psychology.

You could try cracking psychosis with my idea as base. There's an english version in text form else you can translate from danish, if you don't understand. ![Psychosis structure model](https://github.com/DearestDreamWish/spy-information/blob/main/20221005_123606.jpg)If memory, logic and senses were put in a set like a half bubble. And if structure, thought, feeling and intelligence in this sequence were put in a set and interconnected in the sequence called F L O W and diagonal not named and additionally between the named connections/links. And if sequence, plan and action were put in a set interconnected making a triangle. And if from high to low order making a stair The, perspective and momentum were put in a set. And if in a half box where top has link and bottom difference were a set. Would all these sets then not make a puzzle of the consciousness, which when solved then be able to change a persons psychosis?
