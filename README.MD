Neuroscience:
The brain can heal, but it takes time.
The conscious can process 120 bits of information per second.
The subconscious can process 11 million bits of information per second.
An average person has 12 k to 60 k thoughts per day.
We can experience sensory stimuli that's presented for as little as 50 milliseconds (about one-twentieth of a second). It is thought that our brains can, in fact, respond to information that's much briefer than this, lasting less than a quarter of a millisecond.
At least 0.5 ms per synapse. Synapses are cleared within about 1 ms.
A nerve impulse travels at a maximum speed of 120 m/sec.
Humans with normal hearing can hear sounds between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz.
The human ear detects half a millisecond delay in sound.

Electronics:
Hertz is an unit of frequency (of change in state or cycle in a sound wave, alternating current, or other cyclical waveform) of one cycle per second.
1 second = 1000 millisecond. 20,000/1000=20.

Psychology:
20 times hypnosis?
The average person can only hold about 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory at a time. New hacking target? Maybe not the same methods, but could be a start. Look into neuro linguistic programming(NLP), read into neuroscience and psychology.

Psychiatry:
One may be mimicking, because the one is feeling threatened.

Neuro-linguistic programming:
Thought, body parts, processes and so on can be represented as something else.

Signs:
Anxiety=Weakened functioning, paralysis, shaking, muscle tension, disturbance, restless, bad sleep, fatigue and concentration problems.
Sad and depression=Discouraged, lost initiative and will, appearance doesn't matter, stress eating, appear insecure and uncertain, social isolation, nervous, concentration weakened, self-blame and feelings like less self-worth and inadequate, hopeless and confused.
Schizophrenia=Hallucinations, Delusions, Disorganised thinking, Lack of motivation, Slow movement, Change in sleep patterns, Poor grooming or hygiene, Changes in body language and emotions, Less interest in social activities, Low sex drive, Hallucinations, Muddled thinking, hearing voices, seeing things which other people don’t see, feeling someone touching you who is not there, smelling things which other people cannot, Lack of motivation, Losing interest in life and activities, Problems concentrating, Not wanting to leave your house, Not wanting to have conversations with people, Feeling uncomfortable with people, Feeling that you haven’t got anything to say, Losing your normal thoughts and feelings, No energy, problems with remembering things, problems with learning new things, problems with concentrating, problems with making decisions, Irresponsible and unpredictable behaviour, Problems with speech, Self-isolation, Pranks and giggling and health complaints, Unusual movements, often switching between being very active and very still, psychotic.

Routine to rehab:
Read and think "Your thoughts come by itself, with concentration it can come by with effort."
Keep the common world in thought.
Meditate every day with positive and constructive sentences.
Every perspective has a meaning likewise has world views.
Hallucinations can be expression for feelings or thoughts. Remember that it just can, it's not always right.
Dissociations are thoughts from fantasy, meanwhile visual thoughts can be imaginative and relatable.
Reflect before sleep and after about what has happened in the real world.
Remember to remember the real world and train your brain without exhausting, but have energy enough for the day.
Focus to change bad habits and keeping good habits. Listen to positive vibes and positive or neutral music instead bad or something, that has a bad influence. Keep remembering true good moments. Keep track of your own body language and your feelings. Note down abnormalities and check if their are abnormalities, but only if it's convenient. Keep remembering the true world and don't do harm unless it's necessary. Keep remembering that you are yourself and that only you can control yourself.
Take care of yourself with hygiene and nutrition.
Drink enough water every day.
Meditate by closing your eyes and focusing only your breathing for 20 minutes every day.

If you think this is funny, you could simulate and think everything through to train your brain.

If you want to help:
You could try cracking psychosis with my idea as base. There's an english version in text form else you can translate from danish, if you don't understand. ![Psychosis structure model](https://github.com/DearestDreamWish/spy-information/blob/main/20221005_123606.jpg)If memory, logic and senses were put in a set like a half bubble. And if structure, thought, feeling and intelligence in this sequence were put in a set and interconnected in the sequence called F L O W and diagonal not named and additionally between the named connections/links. And if sequence, plan and action were put in a set interconnected making a triangle. And if from high to low order making a stair The, perspective and momentum were put in a set. And if in a half box where top has link and bottom difference were a set. Would all these sets then not make a puzzle of the consciousness, which when solved then be able to change a persons psychosis?

This gets updated sometimes, so remember to check for updates.
