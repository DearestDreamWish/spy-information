Neuroscience:
The brain can heal, but it takes time.
Around 60 bits per second for the maximum processing speed of the human brain.
We can experience sensory stimuli that's presented for as little as 50 milliseconds (about one-twentieth of a second). It is thought that our brains can, in fact, respond to information that's much briefer than this, lasting less than a quarter of a millisecond.
At least 0.5 ms per synapse. Synapses are cleared within about 1 ms.
A nerve impulse travels at a maximum speed of 120 m/sec.
Humans with normal hearing can hear sounds between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz.
The human ear detects half a millisecond delay in sound.

Electronics:
Hertz is an unit of frequency (of change in state or cycle in a sound wave, alternating current, or other cyclical waveform) of one cycle per second.
1 second = 1000 millisecond. 20,000/1000=20.

Psychology:
20 times hypnosis?
The average person can only hold about 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory at a time. New hacking target? Maybe not the same methods, but could be a start. Look into neuro linguistic programming(NLP), read into neuroscience and psychology.

Psychiatry:
One may be mimicking, because the one is feeling threatened.

Routine to rehab:
Read and think "Your thoughts come by itself, with concentration it can come by with effort."
Keep the common world in thought.
Meditate every day with positive and constructive sentences.
Keep distance from thinking about the mental structure and mental sickness, unless it's too much or there are clear signs, but don't keep get into it. Have someone that you can trust help you read online and ask.
Every perspective has a meaning likewise has world views.
Hallucinations can be expression for feelings or thoughts. Remember that it just can, it's not always right.
Dissociations are thoughts from fantasy, meanwhile visual thoughts can be imaginative and relatable.
Reflect before sleep and after about what has happened in the real world.
Remember to remember the real world and train your brain without exhausting, but have energy enough for the day.

If you think this is funny, you could simulate and think everything through to train your brain.

You could try cracking with my idea as base.
