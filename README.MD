Neuroscience:
The brain can heal, but it takes time.
Around 60 bits per second for the maximum processing speed of the human brain.
We can experience sensory stimuli that's presented for as little as 50 milliseconds (about one-twentieth of a second). It is thought that our brains can, in fact, respond to information that's much briefer than this, lasting less than a quarter of a millisecond.
At least 0.5 ms per synapse. Synapses are cleared within about 1 ms.
A nerve impulse travels at a maximum speed of 120 m/sec.
Humans with normal hearing can hear sounds between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz.
The human ear detects half a millisecond delay in sound.

Electronics:
Hertz is a unit of frequency (of change in state or cycle in a sound wave, alternating current, or other cyclical waveform) of one cycle per second.
1 second = 1000 millisecond. 20,000/1000=20.

Psychology:
20 times hypnosis?
The average person can only hold about 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory at a time. New hacking target?

Psychiatry:
One can be mimicking, because the one is feeling threatened.
